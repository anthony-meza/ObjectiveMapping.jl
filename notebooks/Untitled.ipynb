    "### Least-Squares Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ordinary and Weighted Least Squares Solutions \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a set of $n$ observations $\\mathbf y$ and an unknown set of $m$ variables $ \\mathbf x$ that are related by a known linear operator $E$. Mathematically, this is written as: $$ \\mathbf{y = E x}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to determine $\\mathbf{x}$ that are consistent with $\\mathbf{y}$ and $\\mathbf{E}$ is to define and minimize the cost function $J$ where \n",
    "$$J  = (\\mathbf{y - E x})^T(\\mathbf{y - Ex})$$\n",
    "Minimizing this particular cost function with respect to $x$ is known as ordinary least squares. \n",
    "\n",
    "If one wishes to weight particular observations more than others, an alternative form of $J$ could be: \n",
    "$$J  = (\\mathbf{y - E x})^T \\mathbf{W}^{-1} (\\mathbf{y - Ex})$$\n",
    "where $\\mathbf{W} = \\mathbf{I} ~ [\\frac{1}{w_1}, \\frac{1}{w_2}, ..., \\frac{1}{w_n}]^T$ and $\\mathbf{I} $ is the identity matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution that minimizes both ordinary and least squares cost functions are given by \n",

    "\n",
    "Again, suppose we have a set of $n$ observations $\\mathbf y$ and an unknown set of $m$ variables $ \\mathbf x$ that are related by a known linear operator $E$. In this case, let's assume we have many less observations than variables we wish to estimate (i.e. $ n << m$). \n",
    "\n",
    "In linear algebra terms, this is an *underdetermined problem*, meaning that the matrix $\\mathbf{E}^T \\mathbf{W}^{-1} \\mathbf{E}$ will be *ill-conditioned* and therefore cannot be inverted. Therefore, the solution to the ordinary and weighted least squares cost functions cannot be numerically computed. \n",
    "\n",
    "The issue that we are dealing with is the *underdetermined problem* has infinitely many ways to fit the data. One way to limit the number of solutions is to add constraints to $\\mathbf x$. Adding constraints to $\\mathbf x$ can be done in the cost function, $J$, this is known as adding regularization to our cost function. One form of regularization is known as *taper weighted least squares*. This particular cost function is defined as: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ J = (\\mathbf{y - E x})^T \\mathbf{W}^{-1} (\\mathbf{y - Ex}) + (\\mathbf{x}_0 - \\mathbf{x})^T \\mathbf{S}^{-1} (\\mathbf{x}_0 - \\mathbf{x})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The second term is the reglarization term and consists of an additional weighting matrix $S$ and a relaxation solution $x_0$. The solution to this particular cost function is \n",
    "$$ \\mathbf{\\tilde x} = (\\mathbf{E}^T \\mathbf{W}^{-1} \\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{S}^{-1})^{-1}(\\mathbf{E}^T \\mathbf{W}^{-1} \\mathbf{y} + \\mathbf{S}^{-1}\\mathbf{x}_0)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "When $\\mathbf{x}_0 = 0 $ and $\\mathbf{S}^{-1} = \\epsilon \\mathbf{I}$ where $\\epsilon \\approx 0$, the result is the solution to the *standard form Tikhonov regularization cost function*. \n",

    "Our previous estimate $\\mathbf{\\tilde x}$ was obtained in a situation which would have been equivalent to assuming $\\mathbf{n} = 0$. This was equivalent to solving the maximum likelihood problem, which itself is equivalent to the least squares problem where $\\mathbf{W}= \\mathbf{C}_{nn}$. In this case, $\\mathbf{\\tilde x}$ is the also a random variable that has been contaminated by some noise. \n",
